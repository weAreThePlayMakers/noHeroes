##noHeros

is a follow up to [#transeuropacaravans](http://citizenspact.eu/) and [#bleach_v16_62](https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62) and a web tech based take on new-generation-multiplayer-rpg-games in form of interactive web comic with storyline based on real life events transported to dystopian world of europe in mid 21 century.

See img gallery from works on characterTemplate composed into a [teaser](http://bleachv1662.businesscatalyst.com/).

initially the game was intended for 30-35 people taking part in [#transeuropacaravans](http://citizenspact.eu/) an initiative by [european altenatives](http://www.euroalter.com/) which involved six teams traveling in caravans accross europe visiting various locations and interacting with various forms of organised discontent.
